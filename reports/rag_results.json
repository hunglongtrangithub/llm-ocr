A total of thirty-two lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/32) (14 left pelvic, 2 left\ncommon iliac, 1 left periaortic, 10 right pelvic, 4 right common iliac and 1 right periaortic). The pelvic washings\nwere reported as negative for malignancy.

(Gross\nexamination only).\nGross Description\nSeven specimens are received.\nA Container: uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries. Received: specimen consists of a 117 gm, 7.5 x 4.5 x 4 cm\nuterus and cervix with attached bilateral adnexa. The 2.7 cm in diameter ectocervix is grossly unremarkable. At the upper\nuterine fundus is a 4.4 x 3.2 x 1.8 cm thick somewhat friable exophytic tumor mass which grossly penetrates 0.4 cm into\nthe 3.3 cm thick fundic wall. A portion of the tumor is submitted\nprotocol. The tumor is more than 2.5 cm from the\nlower uterine segment. The remainder of the endometrium is somewhat granular and the fundic wall shows whorled pink-\nwhite cut surfaces and contains two fibroid nodules, 1.2 cm in greatest dimension each; one is calcified.\nThe 8 gm left adnexa consists of a 2.5 cm in length by 0.5 cm in diameter segment of tan-pink fallopian tube with\nfimbriated end.

In addition, initial evaluation should include imaging of the chest/abdomen/pelvis by CT or combination MRI/CT.

Tumor cell necrosis is extensive (>80%), status-\npost\nablative therapy.

The diagnosis indicates adenocarcinoma of endometrium, endometrioid type, with focal squamous differentiation.\n\nSpecimen Details: Multiple specimens were submitted, including tissues from the uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes, ovaries, and various lymph nodes (left Jackson's, left external iliac, left hypogastric, left obturator, left common iliac, right external iliac, right hypogastric, right obturator, right common iliac, right para-aortic, and left para-aortic lymph nodes).\n\nMain Diagnostic Findings:\n1. The tumor presents as a 4.0 cm polypoid lesion in the endometrial cavity, with invasion to less than half of the myometrium.\n2. Nuclear grade 2-3 with <6% solid growth and maximal myometrial invasion thickness of 1.0 mm.\n3. Presence of adenomyosis, endocervical involvement, and complex hyperplasia with atypia in the endometrium.\n4. No vascular invasion identified.\n5. Right and left ovaries show endosalpingiosis.\n\nTumor Measurements and Grade:\n- Tumor size: 4.0 cm\n- FIGO Grade: 1 (with <6% solid growth)\n- Myometrial invasion thickness: 1.0 mm\n\nOverall Stage and Lymph Node Evaluation:\n- Lymph Node Evaluation: Benign lymph nodes were found in all excised locations, indicating no lymph node metastasis.\n- Based on the provided information, the overall stage of the cancer and lymph node involvement is not explicitly stated in the report.\n- It is essential to consider further staging and treatment decisions based on additional clinical and imaging assessments.",
