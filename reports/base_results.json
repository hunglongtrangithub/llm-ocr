A portion of the tumor is submitted\nprotocol. The tumor is more than 2.5 cm from the\nlower uterine segment. The remainder of the endometrium is somewhat granular and the fundic wall shows whorled pink-\nwhite cut surfaces and contains two fibroid nodules, 1.2 cm in greatest dimension each; one is calcified.\nThe 8 gm left adnexa consists of a 2.5 cm in length by 0.5 cm in diameter segment of tan-pink fallopian tube with\nfimbriated end.

The 8.8 gm right adnexa consists of a 2 cm in length by 0.5 cm in diameter tan-pink fallopian tube segment with\nfimbriated end.

            "actual_output": "Patient Information: The pathology report pertains to a surgical specimen from a patient with endometrial carcinoma involving the uterus, cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes, and ovaries.\n\nSpecimen Details: The specimen received for analysis included the uterus, cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes, and ovaries, weighing a total of 80 grams. The dimensions of various organs and tissues were documented.\n\nMain Diagnostic Findings: The final diagnosis revealed endometrial carcinoma of serous type with components of clear cell and endometrioid types. Invasion of the vagina was not seen. Invasive implants were noted in the uterine serosa, bilateral adnexae, right pelvic wall, and pericolic tissue. Omental involvement was also reported.\n\nTumor Measurements and Grade: The carcinoma measured 3.5 cm in its greatest dimension. Lymphovascular invasion was present. Lymph node evaluation showed one lymph node involved out of two examined.\n\nOverall Stage and Lymph Node Evaluation: The tumor was staged as pT3b, pN1, pM1, with lymphatic vessel invasion and metastasis to one lymph node. No extranodal extension was observed. The microscopic metastasis consisted of rare minute clusters of tumor cells.\n\nIn conclusion, the patient's pathology report indicates an advanced stage of endometrial carcinoma with lymph node involvement, highlighting the aggressive nature of the disease and the need for further management and treatment.",

The endocervical canal\nmeasures 2.3 cm In length. The endometrial cavity demonstrates an ill-defined friable tan-brown tumor measuring 2.5 cm\nSI x 2.3 cm ML x 2.8 cm AP. The tumor measures 0.3 cm from the anterior serosat surface and 0. 9 cm from the posterior\nserosal surface. The myometrium Is tan and demonstrates a well circumscribed white nodule in the posterior aspect\nmeasuring 0.6 cm . Both fallopian tubes show fimbria . The outer surface of the ovaries is white tan and partly cerebriform.\nThe cut surface of each ovary is tan and unremarkable.
